# Step 1 - Installing Webpack

1. Webpack is an npm package, so we need to install it. Webpack also comes with a CLI tool (command line tool), so we will install that as well.
```
npm i webpack webpack-cli
```

You have been successful when you see webpack and webpack-cli added to your package.json dependencies
